DECOMPOSE_QUERY = """\
Break this research question into a comprehensive search strategy.

Return a JSON object with exactly this structure:

  "cross_domain_queries": ["query from an analogous field (biology, physics, sociology, etc.)"],

Rules:
- sub_queries (3-5): Break the topic into distinct sub-aspects, each specific enough for search
- reformulations (3-5): Rephrase the SAME core concept using DIFFERENT vocabulary.
  This is critical — different fields and papers use different words for the same idea.
  Think: what would a researcher in a DIFFERENT sub-field call the same concept?
  Mix: academic phrasing, keyword-style, question-form, synonym-heavy variants.
  Each reformulation should use words that NONE of the sub_queries use.
- cross_domain_queries (2-3): Search for analogous solutions in OTHER fields
  (e.g., AI memory → neuroscience "episodic memory consolidation during sleep")

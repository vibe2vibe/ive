"""Experimental feature flags and their associated prompt fragments.

Everything in this module is gated behind an opt-in app_settings row. If a
user hasn't explicitly enabled a flag from the dashboard, nothing here takes
effect — no prompts are modified, no tools are injected, no behavior changes.

Adding a new experimental feature:
  1. Add an entry to EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES with metadata the UI can render.
  2. If the feature modifies the system prompt, define the text fragment here.
  3. Wire a check in the relevant code path (e.g. PTY start) that reads the
     flag from app_settings and only activates behavior when == "on".
  4. The /api/settings endpoint auto-surfaces the flag to the frontend.

Every experimental feature MUST declare `modifies_prompt: bool` so the UI
can warn the user appropriately. "This feature adds text to the system
prompt" is the single most important thing a user should know before they
flip the toggle.

# ─── The checkpoint protocol canary ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# When `experimental_checkpoint_protocol` is enabled, Commander appends this
# fragment to every session's system prompt. It instructs the model to call
# the `mcp__commander__checkpoint` tool at key decision points so Commander
# (and plugins) can observe or influence the model's mid-turn reasoning.
#
# This gives Commander an approximate equivalent of Gemini CLI's BeforeModel
# hook on Claude Code sessions via cooperative intercept. It is cooperative,
# not enforced — the model is instructed to call the tool but has no hard
# guarantee it will. The gain is read-write intercept capability; the cost
# is extra tokens (system prompt + periodic tool calls).

MODEL_SWITCHING_PROMPT = """## Commander Dual Model Switching (experimental)

You have access to the `mcp__commander__switch_model` tool that lets you change
your own model mid-conversation. Use this to optimize cost and capability:

### When to switch models

**Planning phase** (use your plan_model — higher capability):
  - Reading and understanding requirements
  - Exploring codebases, tracing dependencies
  - Architectural decisions, designing solutions
  - Writing implementation plans

**Execution phase** (use your execute_model — faster/cheaper):
  - Writing code, making edits
  - Running tools (file reads, grep, etc.)
  - Executing tests and builds
  - Applying known patterns

### How to switch

Call `mcp__commander__switch_model` with the model name:
  - Claude models: "opus", "sonnet", "haiku"
  - Gemini models: "gemini-2.5-pro", "gemini-2.5-flash"

### Protocol

1. Start each task in your plan_model ({plan_model})
2. Once you have a clear plan, call switch_model to your execute_model ({execute_model})
3. After execution is complete, switch back to your plan_model for review
4. For simple follow-ups that don't need planning, stay in execute_model

Do NOT switch models excessively — each switch adds a few seconds of latency.
Switch at natural phase boundaries, not between individual tool calls."""


CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL_PROMPT = """## Commander Checkpoint Protocol (experimental)

Before major reasoning transitions, call the `mcp__commander__checkpoint`
tool with a short JSON payload describing what you're about to do. The tool
will respond with either `{"action": "proceed"}` or updated guidance you
must incorporate before continuing.

Call checkpoint when:
  • You are about to choose between multiple plausible tool calls
  • You have just received unexpected output from a tool and need to pivot
  • You are about to make a non-trivial architectural decision
  • You have completed one logical step and are about to start another

Do NOT call checkpoint:
  • For every single line of thinking
  • For trivial reasoning steps
  • When the current turn is nearly complete and no further decisions remain

Payload format:
  {
    "intent": "<one line: what you're about to do>",
    "context": "<optional: any relevant state>",
    "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high"
  }

Response handling:
  • `{"action": "proceed"}` — continue as planned
  • `{"action": "modify", "guidance": "..."}` — incorporate the guidance
    into your next step before proceeding
  • `{"action": "abort", "reason": "..."}` — stop the current line of
    reasoning and report the reason to the user

This protocol is Commander-specific. Plugins subscribe to checkpoint events
to influence your reasoning without modifying the underlying Claude Code or
Gemini CLI binary."""
